# Q1 2023 CosmWasm Capstone Letter of Intent

To Whom it May Concern:

I submit this letter of intent for my Capstone project as part of the Q1 <CosmWasm Rust> Cohort for the WBA Institute.

The name of the project is **Sentry Nodes**.

I don't think this project *solves a problem* so much as it will *attempt to create a unique format* for launching an NFT project with an emphasis on security and visibility. One definition for the word "Sentry" is:

> Someone who stands guard or watches against some intrusion or unwelcome activity.

Another definition more aptly describes a sentry as:

> A person employed to keep watch for some anticipated event.

The project will be designed around concepts of blockchain security, and will contribute in it's small way to the security of the cosmos network through a series actions automatically performed by project every time an action occurs.

They primary mechanism of the project will be a highly transparent, highly visible allocation of minting and trading proceeds across various domains.

1. Allocations to a variety of Cosmos Network projects.

2. Allocations to purchase native tokens and stake them on a variety of blockchains.

3. Allocations to holders of Sentry Nodes nfts based on the collection and specific id of the NFT.

4. Allocations to core contributors to the Sentry Nodes project.

I plan to use Rust to build a series of smart contracts that manage the allocations of proceeds from the minting and trading of NFTs for a single collection. This series of smart contracts will be designed with reproducability in mind.

I also plan to use other tools to build a dashboard that keeps track of all of the allocations, and displays exactly how much has been allocated across each domain.

Thank you,

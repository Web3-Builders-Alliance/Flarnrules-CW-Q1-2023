# Cluster 2 - Week 2 - Class 7

*February 14, 2023*

Listened to entire class:

- Met new instructor Yan
- Discussed `query` entrypoint into CosmWasm contracts
- Discussed new CosmWasm release

## Query Entrypoint

As discussed previously, there are 3 basic entry points in a CosmWasm contract: 1) instantiate, 2) execute and 3) query

This class focused on the query entry point, which allows reading, but not writing, on the blockchain.

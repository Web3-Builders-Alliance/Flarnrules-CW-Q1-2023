# Sentry Nodes

Sentry Nodes is an open source tool for NFT projects. It aims to accomplish the following objectives:

1. A multi-collection, multi-chain NFT collection deployed on the Cosmos Network.

2. A detailed tutorial for NFT collection deployment in the Cosmos Network, for beginners, by a beginner.

3. A highly customizable and user friendly revenue allocations mechanism for any entity that needs to transparently and permissionlessly allocate proceeds from economic activity.

## 1 - The NFT Collection

The NFT collection is actually a collection of collections,culminating in the deployment of a collection of 11,776 Sentry Nodes on the Stargaze blockchain.

The following is a list of planned collections:

1. A whitelist collection of concept art - ??? NFTs.
2. 4 X Replicated State Machines
3. 64 X Cores, 16 Cores per Replicated State Machine 
4. 512 X Nodescapes, 8 Nodescapes per Core
5. 11,776 x Nodes, 23 Nodes per Nodescape

The collections will exist as a vehicle to display the power of CosmWasm smart contracts, by integrating a variety of CosmWasm functionalities, including multi-chain accounts and multi-chain transactions among others. It is also designed around the pillars of the cosmos network, showcasing and casting a spotlight on several of the core blockchains in the Cosmos Network.

## 2 - The Tutorial

This is the capstone project of a member of the second cohort from Web3 Builder's Alliance (WBA), a collective effort to train future Web3 developers. The WBA began as community project in the Terra Luna ecosystem to train new developers on the powers of the CosmWasm framework for smart contract development.

CosmWasm is a framework for smart contracts deployed in the Cosmos ecosystem. It interfaces with many of the standards realized on the Cosmos SDK and stands for Cosmos Webassembly. It CosmWasm smart contracts are written in rust.

The Tutorial will evolve over time, but intends to incorporate all of the lessons learned through the course of developing and deploying a smart contract on the cosmos network. This tutorial intends to be quite detailed, and is a living document. It documents the process of going from a complete newcomer lacking the basic skills to deploy a smart contract on the cosmos network, to someone who is capable of deploying a full, production quality smart contract that *can do some things* on compatible Cosmos Based Blockchains.

This tutorial is also going to be opinionated, and will include a mixture of technical terminology, theory, philosophy, and at times, humor.

The goal here is to help people to develop a smart contract, through the creation of a smart contract.

## 3 - The Customizable Revenue Allocations Model

Ultimately, this project intends to provide a tool to be used by creators and business owners who want to use blockchains as a transparent and permissionless mechanism to distribute revenues from economic activity.

The idea for this project comes from a conversation I had with my uncle about a business he wanted to run on a blockchain. Basically, he wanted to run a software sales platform, where the sales agents would receive their commissions via a blockchain platform, rather than from some sort of opaque centralized organization where one must trust the people in charge to do what they say they will do.

He wanted to know if there was some way for a business to just build out the entire commissions model on a blockchain. This would both automate the payments, and also provide a completely transparent record of all commissions transactions. All I was able to say to my uncle is "Yeah, I'm sure that can be done, it can probably be

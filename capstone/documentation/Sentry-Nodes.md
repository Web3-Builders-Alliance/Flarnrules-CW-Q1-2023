# Sentry Nodes

Sentry nodes is an on-chain artistic exploration of social and technological systems. The project itself intends to embed deeply into the cosmos network, and integrate various key attributes that makes the cosmos network the *robust public blockchain infrastructure* that it is.

Examples of the systems visually explored and expressed by the "art side" of the project include: security, decentralization, program design, mathematics, algorithms, trade, and community.

At it's core, Sentry Nodes is a project that intends to weave itself into the very fabric of the cosmos ecosystem through a multi-chain collection of NFTs and some cross-chain magic thanks to the power of the powerful smart contract building framework CosmWasm.

## Structure of the Grid

Sentry nodes consist of 11,776 NFTs of "sentry nodes" which are monolith-like tower structures, each with a watchful visor. Sentry Nodes are designed to sort of straddle the line between building and organism, which can be mirrored by the way validator nodes sort of straddle the line between being just a computer, and being the person or group of people who run and maintain the node.

Each of the 11,776 NFTs will be a subset of a collection of 512 "nodescapes" which are NFTs themselves. These nodescapes will consist of 512 unique drawings that are sized to the recommended size for a twitter background image, or 1500x500 pixels.

These nodescapes will be grouped into

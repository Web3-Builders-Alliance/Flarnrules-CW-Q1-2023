# CW721 Spec: Non Fungible Tokens

**CW:** The CW in CW721 stands for CosmWasm, the framework for writing smart contracts on Cosmos chaings in Rust.

**721:** The 721 in CW721 represents the fact that this specification is based on the Ethereum ERC-721 spec.

The official specification readme can be founds here: https://github.com/public-awesome/cw721-ibc

>🧠 Note: The public-awesome organization is the official location for all Stargaze blockchain open source code. Stargaze is a Cosmos blockchain tailor made for NFTs.

The specification consists of 3 implementations.

1. **Base Implementation** - *this is required*
 The base implementation handles ownership, transfers, and allowances.
    > ⚠️ All tokens must have an owner.
    >
    > ⚠️ All tokens must have an ID. 
    >
    > ✨ The ID is an arbitrary string, unique within the contract.

2. **Metadata** - *this is not required*
    > ❓ Metadata is not required probably because it's already generated by the other requirements. I'm not sure.
    >
    > 🧠 This section could use a short description under the Metadata section

3. **Enumerable** - *this is not required*
    > ❔What does enumerable even mean?
    >
    > 🤖 ChatGPT says "Enumerable refers to the ability to list or iterate through a collection of NFTs. An enumerable NFT is one that can be queried and retrieved from a list of all NFTs on the blockchain."
    >
    > Enumerable refers to a type of data structure or object that can be iterated through using a sequential order. A data structure that is enumerable is one that can be retreived and listed.

### 📨 Messages

There are 6 messages.

```
1 TransferNft{recipient, token_id}
```
```
2 SendNft{contract, token_id, msg}
```
```
3 Approve{spender, token_id, expires}
```
```
4 Revoke{spender, token_id}
```
```
5 ApproveAll{operator, expires}
```
```
6 RevokeAll{operator}
```


1. **The TransferNft message:**

    ```
    TransferNft{recipient, token_id}
    ```

    This transfers ownership of the token to `recipient` account. This is designed to send (be sent?) to an address controlled by a private key. 

    Note, this *does not* trigger an actions on the recipient if the recipient is a contract.
    
    This requires `token_id` to point to a valid token, and `env.sender` to  be the owner of it, or have an allowance to transfer it.

    So, `recipient` receives and owns `token_id` after a `TransferNFT` message is executed.

    There are two confusing ambiguities in this description. It's not clear if there are typos in this spec or something else, but I do think it would make sense for this to be rewritten.

    The **first** confusing thing is that the spec says that `TransferNft` is designed "to send to and address". I think it would be more clear if it was written "to be sent to an address". 
    
    The **second** confusing thing is that the spec says the `TransferNft` message "does not trigger any actions on the recipient if it is a contract". There's not a lot of clarity regarding what the 'it' is in this sentence. Is the spec referring to the *sender* or the *recipient*?


2. **The SendNft message:**

    ```
    SendNft{contract, token_id, msg}
    ```
    
    This transfers ownership of the token to

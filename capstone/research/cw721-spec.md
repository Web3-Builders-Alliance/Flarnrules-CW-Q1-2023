# CW721 Spec: Non Fungible Tokens

**CW:** The CW in CW721 stands for CosmWasm, the framework for writing smart contracts on Cosmos chaings in Rust.

**721:** The 721 in CW721 represents the fact that this specification is based on the Ethereum ERC-721 spec.

The official specification readme can be founds here: https://github.com/public-awesome/cw721-ibc

>🧠 Note: The public-awesome organization is the official location for all Stargaze blockchain open source code. Stargaze is a Cosmos blockchain tailor made for NFTs.

The specification consists of 3 implementations.

> 1. **Base Implementation** - *this is required*
>> The base implementation handles ownership, transfers, and allowances.
>> ⚠️ All tokens must have an owner.
>> ⚠️ All tokens must have an ID. 
>> ✨ The ID is an arbitrary string, unique within the contract.

> 2. **Metadata** - *this is not required*
>> ❓ Metadata is not required probably because it's already generated by the other requirements. I'm not sure.
>> 🧠 This section could use a short description under the Metadata section

> 3. **Enumerable** - *this is not required*
>> ❔What does enumerable even mean?
>> 🤖 ChatGPT says "Enumerable refers to the ability to list or iterate through a collection of NFTs. An enumerable NFT is one that can be queried and retrieved from a list of all NFTs on the blockchain."
>> Enumerable refers to a type of data structure or object that can be iterated through using a sequential order. A data structure that is enumerable is one that can be retreived and listed.

### 📨 Messages

`TransferNFT{recipient, token_id}`

There are 6 messages.
The TransferNFT message

This transfers ownership of the token to the `recipient account. This is designed to send to an address controlled by a private key. 

> Note, this *does not* trigger an actions on the recipient if ❓the recipient❓ is a contract.
> There are two confusing ambiguities in this description.
